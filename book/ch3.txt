All around the world
We could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin'
'cause I'm in my prime

Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin'
Girls from California

Alabama baby
Said "hallelujah"
Good God girl
I wish I knew ya

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say, "Hello" and then I say, "I do"
